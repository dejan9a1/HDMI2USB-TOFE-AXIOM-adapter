# TOFE Adapter and Riser Boards

This repository contains designs for **passive** adapter and riser boards for
used with the TOFE interface.

These adapter boards are **transparent** to the TOFE bus and have identical
schematics, only the PCB design differs.

Any **passive** PCI-Express adapter or riser which meets the PCI-Express
specification should be also compatible with the TOFE interface (but the
reverse is not necessarily true).

For [more information on the TOFE interface, see the HDMI2USB website](http://hdmi2usb.tv/tofe).
See the [KiCad website](http://kicad-pcb.org/) for more information on using it.

More information about each board can be found in each directory.
